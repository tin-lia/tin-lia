The switch statement in C++ is a control structure that allows you to execute different parts of code based on the value of an expression. It's particularly useful for situations where you have multiple conditions to check against a single variable, making the code cleaner and more readable than using multiple if-else statements.


step of how to create a switch statement in c++ 

Steps:
• Declare the two variables to hold the numbers for the arithmetic operation
• Take input from the user for both numbers
• Ask the user to input an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /)
• Use the switch statement to perform the appropriate operation base on the operator entered 
• Ensure your program handless devision by zero with an appropriate error message.
